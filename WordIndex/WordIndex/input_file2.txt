Environmental hazards include biological, physical, and 
chemical ones, along with the human behaviors that promote 
or allow exposure. Some environmental contaminants are 
difficult to avoid (the breathing of polluted air, the drinking of 
chemically contaminated public drinking water, noise in open 
public spaces); in these circumstances, exposure is largely 
involuntary. Reduction or elimination of these factors may require 
societal action, such as public awareness and public health 
measures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental 
hazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be 
more morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided. 
Having no choice but to drink water contaminated with very 
high levels of arsenic, or being forced to passively breathe in
tobacco smoke in restaurants, outrages people more than the 
personal choice of whether an individual smokes tobacco. 
These factors are important when one considers how change 
(risk reduction) happens.
